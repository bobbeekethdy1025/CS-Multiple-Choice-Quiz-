CS-Multiple-Choice-Quiz is the repository for the 4th challenge assessment that we were given in the bootcamp.

Above this text you will find two links that will take you to the repository that was created to store the codes and files for this challenge.
The latter link will send you to the live webpage for the quiz that is hosted by github.

Within the repository, you will find an index.html, reset.css, style.css, and script.js.
In these files, you will be able to see how the multiple choice quiz is conducted through Javascrip and the use of APIs.

On the live website you will be prompted with a timed multiple choice quiz. 
You will be prompted whether you answered each question correct or incorrect.
After you are finished with the test, your score will be shown to you and be stored into the local storage of the browser.
You will also be prompted to enter your first and last name into the storage.
To play again, you can refresh the browser but your old scores will be in the local storage.

Thank for you taking the time to read this.
